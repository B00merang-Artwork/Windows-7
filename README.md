This is my update of this theme for Cinnamon 6 - with changed tray icons + some color change to make the text read better. 

+Mint Update tray icon is not in icon folder of any themes (or I don't know about it?), because of this to change this icon i replaced icons in apllet system folder, in my case /usr/share/cinnamon/applets/notifications@cinnamon.org/icons
and you need to do this carefully and make a backup before doing this
Icons that i replaced, in file "icons.tar.gz"
